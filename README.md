## Current Projects

### Marine Mammal Ecology

- Employing hierarchical Bayesian analysis for weaning age to decipher developmental dietary shifts. Analysis of stomach contents and stable isotope techniques to unravel diet composition and resource partitioning among subpopulations; Reproductive processes such as reproductive patterns, gestation periods; how effects of environmental variables, social structures, and anthropogenic pressures on reproductive rates and population viability.
- [Bayesian hierarchical analysis of ontogenetic dietary shifts in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins](https://github.com/YuenWaHo/EEP-Sousa-WeaningAge)
- [Reproductive dynamics of an inshore delphinid reflect demographic consequences of large-scale coastal constructions](https://github.com/YuenWaHo/sousa_repro_dynamics) [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/10.1016%2Fj.biocon.2024.110690-logo?style=flat-square&label=DOI&labelColor=a9bcc2&color=edf1f0&link=10.1016%2Fj.biocon.2024.110690)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2024.110690)

### Underwater Soundscapes

- The significance of sound in aquatic environments covers marine organisms' use of sound for communication, navigation, and foraging, as well as the impacts of human-induced noise pollution. Efforts focus on mitigating adverse effects and preserving marine acoustic habitats.

### Microplastics and its impacts

- Distribution and impact processes of microplastic particles in marine environments; how these particles are ingested by marine life and the subsequent ecological risks, including potential harm to marine species and disruption of food webs.
